## Based on the book "The Prisoner's Dilemma" and John Von Neuman's IPD (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma) competition. 
I strove to make the most complete form of the competition as of yet, featuring all major styles ('strats' in code) of gameplay in the tournament. 
Consists of over 22 strats and multiple competition formats.
